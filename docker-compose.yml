# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When 'docker-compose up --build' is run, this file is executed.
#
# Its purpose is to run 3 containers (nginx, flask and postgres) and
# attach them together in a common network with shared volumes.
#
# The current configurations should not be changed. The only thing you
# might want to change are the environment variables in the flask
# container. If you don't know what environment variables are, check
# this out: http://do.co/1I8tUVm
#
# You may be wondering why we use Docker. When you have bigger projects
# that require multiple services like the actual web app, the web server,
# a database and more, you would need to install it separately. This not
# only takes time, but you would have to reconfigure it every single time
# you install it on a new machine. What Docker does is automate all this
# process for you, so that you only have to run one command.
